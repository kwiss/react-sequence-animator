# react-sequence-animator v2
Migrating to this new major version is fairly simple.
The only breaking change is ESM support which requires changing how importing the components is written.
The main change in this version is infrastructure and dependencies updates.
There are no changes in the usage or features of the components.

## Typescript
react-sequence-animator v2 is now written in Typescript and the components expose their types via their index file

## ESM
The library now supports ESM imports, which means imports such as:
```ts
import SpriteAnimator from 'react-sequence-animator/SpriteAnimator';
```
is not supported anymore, and imports should be written like this:
```ts
import { SpriteAnimator, SequenceAnimator } from 'react-sequence-animator';
```
